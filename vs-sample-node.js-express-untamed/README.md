# vs-sample-node.js-express-untamed

I just installed NTVS, "a plug in that turns visual studio into a Node.js IDE"
and wrote my first sample with it.

This is my first practice on Node.js using Visual Studio, perhaps Yeoman would be a better fit but for a developer who spent the last 10 years at least mostly on the .net platform, I feel the future is promising (for me)!

## This project
It is my first try in the wild, the project is composed of a set of fake Rest services mimicking some CRUD operations
and there the reason why I called it vs-sample-node.js-express-untamed


## More
The project template used in this project : Basic Node.js Express 4 Application
